## Public Methods

`static Func<float, float> EaseInBack(Func<float, float> easeIn, Func<float, float> easeOut)` combines two easing arbitrary functions in to one (easeIn for x > 0.5, easeOut for x < 0.5).

`static float EaseInBack(float x)`

`static float EaseOutBack(float x)`

`static float EaseInQuint(float x)`

`static float EaseOutQuint(float x)`

`static float EaseInSin(float x)`
